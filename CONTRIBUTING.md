## Requirements

In project we use [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) and [gcc compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

## Usage of lint.sh script
Prefered way for development build is to use a lint.sh script you can find in project directory.
This will ensure your code is well formated and run all unit tests.

## Contributing A Patch
1.  Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the
    [issue tracker](https://github.com/dalonga-kohi/cman/issues).
2.  Please don't mix more than one logical change per submittal, because it
    makes the history hard to follow. If you want to make a change that doesn't
    have a corresponding issue in the issue tracker, please create one.
3.  Also, coordinate with team members that are listed on the issue in question.
    This ensures that work isn't being duplicated and communicating your plan
    early also generally leads to better patches.
4.  Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
5.  Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style in the sample to which
    you are contributing.
6.  Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.
7.  Submit a pull request.
